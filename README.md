# Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. 
The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. 
The pivot selection and partitioning steps result in a well-balanced divide of the elements, allowing for an efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) on average. 
Quick sort is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms such as merge sort and heapsort, due to its smaller overhead and good behavior on smaller inputs.
